<h2>Controller Rendering</h2>

<p>This is an example of a controller rendering. Simply create a rendering based on one of the templates below and add that rendering to the presentation controls for an item or on a template's standard values.</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="text-info">/sitecore/templates/System/Layout/Renderings/Controller rendering</span></li>
    <li><span class="text-info">/sitecore/templates/User Defined/MVC Contrib/Layout/Renderings/Controller rendering with validation</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The text below comes from a strongly typed model generated by the <span class="text-info">Website.Controllers.SimpleController</span> class and passed to the view for rendering.</p>

<h3>Validating Controller and Action Field Values</h3>

<p>The contrib package includes a ControllerRenderingValidator which validates the Controller and Action fied values of items based on the `Controller rendering with validation` template.</p>

<p>A Controller Rendering template contains fields for the Controller and the Controller Action. The Controller field can either specify the Controller name using <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/asp.net/asp.net-mvc-controllers-and-conventions/" target="_blank">convention</a>, that is without the “Controller” suffix or by entering the fully qualified path to the controller, eg. “Website.Controllers.SimpleController,AssemblyName”.</p>

<p>If the controller rendering has been based on the <span class="text-info">/sitecore/templates/User Defined/MVC Contrib/Layout/Renderings/Controller rendering with validation</span> template then the controller and action fields will be validated by searching the website's bin directory for to ensure that the controller and method exist.</p>

<p>The sample package has installed a controller rendering in your content tree, the path to this item is <span class="text-info">/sitecore/layout/Renderings/MVC Contrib/Content/Simple Controller Rendering</span></p>
<p>Try editing the Controller and Controller Action fields and then running Validation from the Review chunk on the toolbar.</p>
